## Q: 
Add Functions for majin buu; cell; fusion between characters; frieza and having stages of power; What do we’re call intakes for this type of content from other lore?

## A: 
To answer both parts of your prompt, let’s break this down into two segments:

* * *

### **PART A: Adding Functions for Characters & Concepts**

You're looking to add **“functions”** for characters like _Majin Buu, Cell, Frieza,_ and _fusions_. In a systemized or symbolic lore structure, this means assigning **mechanics, rules, or abilities** to these characters in a way that can be reused, modified, or translated across your own world or mythos.

Here’s a starting pass:

#### **MAJIN BUU FUNCTION**

*   **Function Name:** `Absorb_Morph()`
    
*   **Core Mechanic:** Consumes opponents to assimilate their powers and traits, altering form and personality.
    
*   **Keywords:** assimilation, mimicry, chaos-stability cycle, entropy.
    
*   **System Role:** Wildcard entity — acts as a threat _and_ potential evolution node.
    

#### **CELL FUNCTION**

*   **Function Name:** `Perfect_Evolution(stage)`
    
*   **Core Mechanic:** Bio-synthetic organism that self-improves through combat experience and absorption.
    
*   **Keywords:** perfection loop, DNA harvesting, tactical patience.
    
*   **System Role:** Strategic villain archetype — needs time/resources to reach full potential.
    

#### **FRIEZA FUNCTION**

*   **Function Name:** `Stage_Unlock(level)`
    
*   **Core Mechanic:** Has multiple locked power states that can be released in sequence.
    
*   **Keywords:** transformation thresholds, cruelty + elegance, latent power.
    
*   **System Role:** Power escalation benchmark — villain as measuring stick.
    

#### **FUSION FUNCTION**

*   **Function Name:** `Synch_Merge(entity1, entity2)`
    
*   **Core Mechanic:** Two entities combine into one, gaining composite strengths but introducing instability or time limits.
    
*   **Keywords:** hybridization, synergy cost, perfect imperfection.
    
*   **System Role:** Emergency override, ultimate move — can shift fate when used right.
    

Each of these can be structured as:

```plain text
::Function_ID::        [Synch_Merge]
::Category::           [Fusion/Transformation]
::Inputs::             [entity1, entity2]
::Outputs::            [Composite_Entity]
::Cost::               [Time_Limit, Energy_Drain, Instability]
::Lore_Tag::           [Divine Intervention / Emergency Mechanic]
```

We can turn each one into a reusable "power card" for your system.

### **PART B: What Do We Call These Intakes from Other Lore?**

You're essentially asking: _what's the term for importing mechanics, motifs, or character archetypes from established franchises like Dragon Ball into your own myth-system?_

Here are some possible terms depending on tone and use-case:

| **Term** | **Use Case** | **Tone** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Lore_Syncs** | Implies synchronization or mapping with external mythologies. | Neutral / Systematic |
| **Myth Imports** | Emphasizes taking motifs from broader myth pools. | Literary / Academic |
| **Source Ports** | Borrowed from modding/gaming, means re-implementing something in a new engine. | Technical / Meta |
| **Power Echoes** | Suggests your system echoes or reinterprets power forms from other systems. | Poetic / Meta |
| **Reflex Arcs** | Metaphor for reflexively adapting external stimuli into your own structure. | Symbolic |
| **Remix Threads** | Nods to sampling/remixing culture. | Creative / Music-based |
| **Lore Parasites** | Parasite not as pejorative, but as adaptive mechanism. | Subversive |
| **DNA_Frags** | Implies extracting core genetic sequences from another system for synthesis. | Sci-fi / Bio-tech |
| **Totems** | References symbolic channeling of other archetypes. | Mythic / Ritualistic |

**My recommendation:**  
Use **`DNA_Frags`** when referencing specific characters or mechanics (e.g. “This fusion mechanic is based on a DNA_Frag from Dragon Ball Z’s Potara Fusion”).

And use **`Lore_Sync`** or **`Remix Thread`** when referencing full themes or systems across multiple characters/franchises.

* * *

Would you like me to build a formal import protocol for integrating `DNA_Frags` or `Lore_Syncs` into your own myth-engine?  
Could include: tags, formatting rules, attribution system, and transformation notes.
